## Product Life-cycle
A typical product will follow the 4 stages of life-cycle outlined below.

## 1) Ideation
Ideation covers both Net New products and new features or functionality within
existing products.

### Net New Products
Net New products, budgets and resources are identified and assigned annually.
We take a bottom-up approach to Net New product ideation. The details can be
found below.

### Features and Functionality
New features and functionality can be proposed at any time, from anyone
(internal or external).

The new feature pipeline is reviewed every 6 weeks and the inbox is reviewed by
the product team and any accepted features are prioritised for future delivery.

The details on how to contribute to products can be found
[here](../README#contributing).

## 2) Build
Our approach to building products is closely aligned with the Agile
methodologies.

### Roadmap
To help translate the strategic vision of the product into deliverables and to
facilitate communication with internal and external stakeholders, we maintain a
roadmap.

Roadmap planning happens once per quarter. During Roadmap planning, all new
feature requests and other proposals will be considered and planned in
appropriately.

### Ceremonies
We follow `SCRUM` and typically work in 2-week sprints. The sprints are
supported by key ceremonies including `planning`, `backlog grooming` and
`retrospectives`.

Typically our delivery teams will focus 4 sprints on Roadmap items and features
followed by 1 sprint of bug fixing and reducing technical debt.

## 3) Release
Once the product or feature is ready to be shared with the world, it will run
through the following stages:

* Early Access Release
* Alpha
* Beta
* General Availability

The details of each of these phases can be found [here](/release-phases)

## 4) Feedback
Collecting feedback from our customers, our team mates and end users is
essential to on-going product improvements.
