# Product
Product is defined as technology that is owned by the business. It encapsulates
anything built by the Product engineering team or acquired and integrated into
the Product team.

Product may be dependent on 3rd party vendors for component parts (through OEM)
but the Intellectual Property (IP) to the complete solution must be owned by the
business.

or solution sets.

products to a pre-defined product lifcycle.
