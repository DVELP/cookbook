# Product @ DVELP
Our Playbook for creating products at DVELP.

## Our Mission
To create solutions that help businesses revolutionise how they speak with
their customers.

## Strategy
To [identify White Space](#fill-the-white-space) in [Partner Solutions](/partner-solutions),
[Prototype rapidly](#get-close-with-customers) and validate hypothesis amongst
our customer base. Pick winners early and [scale up](#scale-up)
through strong vendor partner relationships.

### Get Close with Customers
Through close relationships with customers we can recognise industry trends early
and identify opportunities to add value through products

### Fill the White Space
Our proximity to customers coupled with deep expertise in our
[Partner Solutions](partner-solutions) means we are uniquely positioned to
identify and fill `White Space` in existing solutions and deliver new features
and prototypes to our customer base to rapidly validate hypotheses.

### Scale-Up
Build a strong commercial and go-to-market framework with our
[Partner Vendors](partner-solutions) through which we can scale-up products
that have shown early success with existing customers.

## What We Believe In
We believe, above all else, in the following principles, which act as guides to
help us build incredible products:

**Focus Above the Value Line**
We spend as much time and focus as we can on things that will add value to our
customers and to the end user.

**Ship Early and Often**
We don't like big bang releases. We break down complex tasks and ship small
features regularly to get early feedback and reduce risk.

**We Are About Quality**
At our core, we are about quality. We obsess over detail.
