# Contributing
We take a `bottom up approach` to product development, which means we want to
hear your opinion. Whether a customer a teammate or an end user, we want to hear
from you.

## Existing Products
If you have some feedback, a feature request or potentially a bug that you would
like us to look at, please complete this [form]().

Requests for existing products will be reviewed as follows:

* **Bugs:** Same day
* **Feature Requests & Feedback:** Monthly

Requests will be triaged, discussed and if we feel are suitable planned into the
product roadmap in the case of bugs, escalated for resolution.

## Net New Products
We believe the greatest ideas originate from those who are closest to the
problem and closest to the customer. If you have an idea for a new product or
have identified an industry trend or repeated customer problem, we want to help
you realise the solution.

To share your insights and ideas with us, please take the time to complete a
[canvas](https://sabioltd.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/Execution-CloudFocus/ESaOBYOz-W5PnT0krqU6U_kBEGDEk_4qdBmjvt-7mY1KKw?e=BnEetd).

We will review canvases every 6 weeks where we will invite you to an open forum
to elaborate on the canvas and discuss feasibility for delivery.

Details of all stages for Net New Product delivery are as follows:

* **Ideation:** Draw up an initial canvas and submit it to the product team
* **Discussion Forum:** Open forum to discuss new canvas ideas (6 weekly)
* **Extended business plan:** An extended (5-6 page) business plan, including
  financials, for the product
* **Budgeting:** Budget approval for the investment
* **Resourcing:** Assemble the team to `Own The Product`
* **Build:** Build!
