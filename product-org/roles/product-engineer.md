# Product Engineer
The Product Engineer, whether front-end, back-end or full-stack is at the heart
of the value chain. Our Product Engineers aim to write as little code as
possible to deliver streamlined and precision products to customers.

## Responsibilities
* Full Feature life-cycle management
* Ensuring code quality and longevity of functional implementations
* Translating user-stories into working digital solutions
* Enabling design and UAT
* Bug fixing & tech-debt management
* On-call support

### Technical Excellence
Our Product Engineers deliver technical excellence at every step of the process.
They fundamentally understand the importance of tried and tested programming
practices to create solutions that are built to last. Each line of code is
meticulously reviwed and deliberated upon to ensure continued adherence.

Our engineering team continues to redefine best-practice.

## Communication
The Product Engineer has two key stakeholder sets for communication:

### Internal
* *Lead Product Enginer:* [Report](#reporting) progress on features, associated
  epics and discussion on target architecture and implementation choices
* *Product Management:* key updates on features which are on the critical
  delivery path
* *Product Designer:* Close working relationship to prototype ideas and provide
  staged solutions for sign-off pre-production

### External
* *Customers:* All member of the product team, including Engineers owe a duty of
  care to customers, to listen to issues and identify areas for improvement

## Reporting
Our Product Engineers will typically be dedicated to a single product and will
report to both the [Lead Product Engineer](../lead-product-engineer) for technical
decisions and guidance and to the [Product Owner](../product-owner) for task
prioritisation and strategic direction.
