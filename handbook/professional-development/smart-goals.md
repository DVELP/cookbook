# Good practice on Setting Goals

Our goal setting process is flexible and accommodates all kinds of goals. We
want you to set goals that best fit with what you want to achieve. Your review
goals are based on:

* Internal and external feedback
* Expectations of your role
* Your own personal ambitions
* The wider company goals

The background to setting any goal is thinking about what we want to achieve.
Both in our careers and personally. We encourage all our employees to think
about their ambitions and discuss these regularly with their manager.

Once we have a good idea of what we want to achieve, it's useful to break this
into smaller steps, or goals.


# SMART

A good way to create goals is to follow the SMART format. This means when
writing goals, we focus on each one having the following attributes:

**Specific:** Try to keep each goal specific and clear. A narrower scope will
help you focus more.

**Measurable:** Trying to associate a number with your goal is the easiest way
to achieve this.  This is very useful in helping you say definitively that
you've achieved your goal, avoiding subjectivity. It is also more motivating
because you can track progress and see how close you are to achieving your
goals.

**Achievable:** A goal should be something you have the means to accomplish with
the resources you have available. For example, if it's a personal goal - you
shouldn't set a goal that will require a 10 person team and large budget to
achieve.

**Realistic:** Ambitious goals are motivating, we don't want to make our goals
too easy to achieve or they become pointless. However, being over-ambitious can
lead to pressure and frustration rather than motivation. As a company we want
continuous improvement - you don't need to go from 1 to 100 in a week.

**Time based:** Giving ourselves a time limit for goals helps to make sure
they're not forgotten about. Our process has a convenient review point every 3
months.  It can also be useful to create some shorter term goals so everything
isn't left until the end of the quarter. Equally, it's OK to have a longer term
annual goal that you make gradual process on throughout the year.

### Summary The SMART methodology is widely adopted and seen as useful to help
people set good goals. If you need help with using it, please speak to your line
manager.  This should be a useful process, but if it doesn't fit for your goal
then don't worry. This document is a guide only, our review process can include
any kind of goal as long as it's agreed with you and your manager.
