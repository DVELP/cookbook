# External Training Courses

If you find an external training course that you think would help you progress
professionally, we encourage you to make a proposal to your Line Manager to
take this course.

If your Line Manager agrees that the course is a good opportunity for you
individually and us as a business, he or she can propose the course to the [HR
Manager and CEO](../readme.md#contacts).

The Line Manager, HR Manager and CEO will then discuss whether we can make the
time and/or money available to allow you to take the course.
