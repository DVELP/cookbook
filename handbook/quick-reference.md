## Place of Work

**DVELP is a remote-first company**. As the default, we expect all of our team to
work remotely. We have a hub in London for those who wish to use it.

## Communication

As a remote-first team, communication is key to our day-to-day efficiency. We
primarily use Slack, with a channel per project, but also expect our team to be
responsive to email.

Communication helps **promote transparency, breakdown barriers and build trust**.
We encourage over communication at all times.

## Meetings

We aim to keep meetings to a minimum so itâ€™s important we spend our time
together efficiently.

We run a weekly team stand-up at 10am on Mondays (London) and each project will
typically have their own daily stand-up.

Meetings give us the chance to share knowledge, understanding and our
objectives as a team working together. We expect people to be **punctual, prepared
and respectful of each others time**.

## Time Management

Our typical working day is 9am - 6pm (London).

We understand that efficient working hours may differ from one individual to the
next and we encourage flexibility. We must however respect the requirements of
those who we work with to ensure we are available when required.

For any extended time AFK (> 2 hours), we request that the relevant people are
notified 24hrs in advance.

## Do Not Disturb Mode

As developers it is important to be able to focus on the code we are writing.
This requires being free from unnecessary distractions.

The way we signal to the rest of the team that we are in such a focus session is
by turning on Slack's `Do not disturb` mode.

When this status is turned on, people who try to send us a Slack message receive
a notification saying we are in `Do not disturb` mode and asking whether they
want to send a notification despite this.

In the rare circumstances where a pressing urgent matter needs immediate
attention, we ask for a notification to be sent anyway. Otherwise we make a note
to get back in touch with the recipient later, when he or she is no longer in
`Do not disturb` mode. One way of doing this is to set the `Remind me about this
in 1 hour` setting in Slack.

As a general rule, we try not to be in `Do not disturb` mode for longer than 2
hours at a time, to give the rest of the team a chance to catch up with us
in-between focus sessions.

## Deadlines & Overtime

We work on projects, which from time-to-time, will have hard deadlines.

Although we aim to prevent an increase in workload through careful planning, we
understand longer days are sometimes required to meet a deadline.

We don't operate an overtime remuneration structure, but we recommend that
people take time off in lieu to rest-up.

## Holidays

Time-off is extremely important to our well-being. We encourage our team to make
full use of their holiday allowance.

We track holiday days in Charlie HR and request that holidays are booked at
least 2 weeks in advance. We have a low-touch review process and aim to grant
all holidays requested. 

Our team is distributed across different countries with different public holidays.
To simplify the management of these public holidays, your country's number of
public holidays per year are added to your annual holiday allowance. You're free 
to take these public holidays on their official date or any other day in the year. 
When you do take a public holiday you need to request this as a normal holiday on 
CharlieHR, as you would any other holiday.

We ask our team to use common sense when requesting holidays and be mindful of
any pressing project deadlines or pre-existing holiday arrangements.

**It is the responsibility of the individual to give sufficient notice to the
team they are working with (internal and external) of any time off.**

Holiday days are not carried from one calendar year to the next.

### Public Holidays

Our team work from many different countries, each with their own public
holidays. We request individuals follow the holidays set by their **country
of residence** and within the parameters of the individuals allowance.
