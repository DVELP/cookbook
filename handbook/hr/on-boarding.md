# On-boarding

When someone joins our team, we complete an on-boarding process.

This process is defined in a CharlieHR checklist template which can be found
[here](https://dvelp.charliehr.com/checklist_templates).

It is the joint responsibility of the individual's Line Manager and the [HR
Manager](../best-practice/system-admins.md#contacts) to ensure the on-boarding
checklist is completed.
