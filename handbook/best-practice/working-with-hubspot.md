# Working with Hubspot

We use [Hubspot](https**://www.hubspot.com/) to track deals in our sales pipeline.

## Properties of Deals

The below is a list of the most important properties we track per deal with an 
explanation what each property represents.

1. **Stage**: Our deals go through multiple stages in our sales pipeline. With each 
   stage the probability that the deal closes and turns into a project increases.
2. **Forecast Amount**: This is the size of the project we expect this deal to 
   result in at the point that it enters our process (i.e. in the Sales Qualified Lead
   stage). We set this once and then never edit it again.
3. **Forecast close date**: This is the date on which we expect us to close the deal at the 
   point in time that the deal enters our process (i.e. in the Sales Qualified Lead
   stage). This is set once and then never edited again.
4. **Amount**: This is the amount that we expect to quote in the proposal if 
   the deal makes it to the proposal writing stage. It is continuously updated until a deal closes 
   and reflects our best estimate of what this value will be at any one time.
5. **Close date**: This is the date on which we expect to close the deal. The deal is closed when the contract governing the associated piece of work is signed. The close date is perpetually updated 
   and reflects our best estimate of what this date will be at any one time.
6. **Probability**: This is the probability with which we expect the deal to close. It is
   perpetually updated and reflects our best estimate of what this date will be at any
   one time.
7. **Deal Owner**: This is the person responsible for doing everything we can do close the
   deal. The deal owner is eligible for the sales commission associated with the deal.
