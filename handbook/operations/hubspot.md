# Tracking Deals with Hubspot

We use [Hubspot](https://app.hubspot.com) to track potential deals that our
sales team is working on.

This document lays out our approach.

## Stages

As a deal progresses through our sales process, it moves through the following
stages, which we track on Hubspot:

* Inbox
* Sales Qualified Lead
* Meeting Scheduled
* Opportunity Confirmed
* Proposal Submitted
* Meeting to Discuss Proposal
* Contract in Progress
* Closed Won
* Closed Lost

## Metrics We Track

In order for us to analyse our performance as a sales team and to be able to
plan around our sales pipeline, there are a number of metrics we track using
Hubspot. These are captured as "Properties" of "Deals" and include:

* **Forecast Amount**: This is the amount that we expect the deal to close for
  when it reaches the Sales Qualified Lead stage. It is set while the deal is at
this stage and is not edited thereafter
* **Forecasted Close Date**: This is the date that we expect the deal to close
  on when it reaches the Sales Qualified Lead stage. It is set while the deal is
at this stage and is not edited thereafter
* **Amount**: This is the amount of revenue we expect a deal to generate. It is
  continuously updated to reflect our best assessment of this value at any given
time
* **Close Date**: This is the date on which we expect the deal to close. It is
  continuously updated to reflect our best assessment of this date at any given
time
* **Probability**: This is the probability with which we expect the deal to
  close. This typically increases as deals move through the different stages. It
is continuously updated to reflect our best assessment of this value at any
given time
* **Deal Owner**: This is the person that is responsible for closing the deal.
  They are responsible for the commercial management for all projects involving
the specific client and they will be assigned the Sales Commission resulting
from deals with that client.
* **Project Start Date**: This is the date on which we expect the team to start
  working full time on the project. This is set as soon as an assessment can be
made and no later than the Project Close Date
* **Stage**: Our deals go through multiple stages in our sales pipeline. With each 
   stage the probability that the deal closes and turns into a project increases.
