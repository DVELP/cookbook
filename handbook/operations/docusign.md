# DocuSign Process

We use [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.co.uk/) to facilitate the process of signing official documents without requiring hard copies.

We have one account and that is run by Ruby Williams. 

If you have a document that needs to be signed digitally, please email this to Ruby with instructions on who this needs to be sent to including names and email addresses.

Once the document has been signed by all parties, Ruby will send you the signed PDF. It is then your job to file it in the appropriate place on the GoogleDrive. We do not use DocuSign as a file storage for all signed documents as only Ruby has access to it.

Likely locations you will want to file signed documents include:
* [Client folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J2HEA6BF4USDY9HQ9rNmyn6_2ihmfmEw) for contractual agreements with clients
* [CharlieHR](https://dvelp.charliehr.com/) for employment contracts of our team members (go to relevant individual -> documents -> contract)
* [Recruiter Commmercial Terms](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X6-eNAntXy4X3CnAEvREl87NPJsqUfP7)
