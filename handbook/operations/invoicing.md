# Invoicing Procedure

## Writing invoices

This is the process that should be followed to invoice our clients for our work, one week at a time:
1. The project team works on a project for a week.
2. The following Monday morning (i.e. by noon) Project Managers review and sign-off on the hours reported by Developers for that week on Harvest. This [Utilisation Looker Dashboard](https://dvelp.eu.looker.com/dashboards/3) informs the Sign-off.
3. By the end of play on this same Monday, we send out invoices for the hours  worked the previous week.


## Aged Receivables

Every Monday, there will be an Invoicing Review at which we review our Aged Receivables:

The [Invoicing Looker Dashboard](https://dvelp.eu.looker.com/dashboards/27?Untitled%20Filter=7%20days&filter_config=%7B%22Untitled%20Filter%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22past%22,%22values%22:%5B%7B%22constant%22:%227%22,%22unit%22:%22day%22%7D,%7B%7D%5D,%22id%22:6%7D%5D%7D) informs this Invoice Review.
