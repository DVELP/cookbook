# Information Transfer Policy

Sharing information either between our employees, trusted suppliers or clients
is essential in the services we provide.

This document sets out guidelines to help ensure information is shared with
confidence and integrity either electronically or via hard copy.


## Considerations

A key risk is knowlingly, but not maliciously sharing data with people who
shouldn't have access to it. The following are some key considerations to
reflect on before sharing any information that is or could be deemed sensitive
as laid out by our [Infomation Classification Policy](classification-of-information.md).

* **Don't assume** someone is entitled to the information just because they have
  asked for it

* **Consider any agreements** that may or may not be in place which would cover
  the transfer of the information and potentially lay out a preferred method

* **Don't overshare**. Only share the information which is required to reach your
  resolution

* **Identify the channel** most suited to sharing the information; this may not be
  the easiest

* **Assess the risk** of transferring the information


## Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure

Ahead of commencing any project with a new client, we recommend completing a
Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA). The agreement will limit the audience
for any information shared and outline the preferred channels to transfer it by.


## Choosing a Channel

Once you are happy the information you are about to share is going to the right
person and they have the correct priveleges to access it, you should choose the
best method or channel to send it via.

Take into account the following items:

* The nature of the data, whether it's publicly accessible, sensitive or
  confidential
* Size or quantity of data
* The potential impact of data loss
* The risk of sending the data


### Email

Whether you are sending information to another `@dvelp.co.uk` email or to an
address on an external domain, you need to consider the security of that
information.

As a rule of thumb, don't use email for sharing [Confidential
Data](classification-of-information.md#categories). If you have been
expressly requested to share data via email make sure it is contained in an
encrypted, password protected folder.

The password must be shared via a separate channel, such as Slack or SMS.


### Slack & Instant Messages

Slack is not, by default, secure to the level required to share [Confidential
Data](classification-of-information.md#categories).
[Internal](classification-of-information.md#categories) and
[Public](classification-of-information.md#categories) data can however be
shared freely on Slack inside of the DVELP workspace.

If you are required to share [Confidential
Data](classification-of-information.md#categories) via Slack make sure it is
in an encrypted, password protected folder. The password must be shared via a
different channel (not Slack channel) such as SMS or email.

You **must not** use any other IM services for discussing [Confidential
Data](classification-of-information.md#categories).


### Collaboration Tools

Collaboration tools include Trello, Harvest and any other software that may be
used collaboratively throughout the project process.

[Confidential Data](classification-of-information.md#categories) should not be
shared via any collaboration tool or service.

[Internal](classification-of-information.md#categories) and
[Public](classification-of-information.md#categories) data that is pertinent
to a project can be shared via collaboration tools. Before sharing any
[Internal](classification-of-information.md#categories) data, you must first
verify that it can only be accessed by those collaborators with the relevant
permissions.


### Hard-copy & Paper

Although sending hardcopies, on paper via the postal service or courier is rare,
it must be considered.

Any [Internal](classification-of-information.md#categories) or
[Confidential](classification-of-information.md#categories) information sent
via letter should be correctly addressed to the individual recipient (not
company or department) and with the correct postage.

You as the sender are responsible for the package up until its arrival at the
destination.


### Removable Devices

The use of removable devices is covered in our [Acceptable Use
Policy](./acceptable-use.md#use-of-external-media-on-company-assets).
