# Acceptable Use of Assets Policy

## Purpose

This policy specifies requirements related to the use of DVELP computing
resources and data assets by DVELP team members so as to protect our customers,
team members, contractors, company, and other partners from harm caused by both
deliberate and inadvertent misuse. Our intention in publishing this policy is
not to impose restrictions but outline information security guidelines intended
to protect DVELP assets.

It is the responsibility of every member of our Community to interact with DVELP
computing resources and data in a secure manner and to that end we provide the
following acceptable use standards related to computing resources, company and
customer data, mobile and tablet devices, and removable and external media
storage devices.

## Scope

This policy applies to all DVELP team members, contractors, advisors, and
contracted parties interacting with DVELP computing resources and accessing
company and customer data.

## Acceptable Use and Security Requirements of Computing Resources at DVELP

## General Use and Ownership

DVELP-managed assets are provided to conduct DVELP business with consideration
given for limited personal use.

Those receiving DVELP-provided assets are responsible for exercising good
judgement when using DVELP-managed computers and accessing DVELP-managed data.

As per our [Device Policy](asset-management.md), evidence of device encryption
and device serial number must be provided to DVELP prior to the completion of
the on-boarding period.

## Security and Proprietary Information

All DVELP data is categorized and must be handled in accordance with the Data
Classification Policy. All computing assets that connect to any part of the
DVELP network, or 3rd party services that are used by DVELP, must be handled in
accordance with our our [Working in Secure Areas
Policy](physical-and-environmental-security.md#working-in-secure-areas).

## Unacceptable Use

Team members and contractors may under no circumstances use DVELP-managed
resources for activities that are illegal or prohibited under applicable law.

### Unacceptable System and Network Activities

Prohibited system and network activities include, but are not limited to, the
following:
* Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by copyright,
  trade secret, patent or other intellectual property, or similar laws or
  regulations.
* Unauthorised copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted material.
* Exporting software, technical information, encryption software, or technology
  in violation of international or national export control laws.
* Intentional introduction of malicious programs into DVELP networks or any
  DVELP-managed computing device.
* Intentional misuse of any DVELP-managed computing device or DVELP networks
  (e.g. for cryptocurrency mining, botnet control etc.).
* Sharing your credentials for any DVELP-managed computer or 3rd party service
  that DVELP uses, with others, or allowing use of your account or a
  DVELP-managed computer by others. This prohibition does not apply to
  single-sign-on or similar technologies, the use of which is approved.
* Using a DVELP computing asset to engage in procuring or transmitting material
  that is in violation of sexual harassment policies or that creates a hostile
  workplace.
* Making fraudulent offers of products, items, or services originating from any
  DVELP account.
* Intentionally accessing data or logging into a computer or account that the
  team member or contractor is not authorised to access, or disrupting network
  communication, computer processing, or access.
* Executing any form of network monitoring that intercepts data not intended for
  the team memberâ€™s or contractor's computer, unless when troubleshooting
  networking issues for the benefit of DVELP.
* Circumventing user authentication or security of any computer host, network,
  or account used by DVELP.

### Unacceptable Email and Communications Activities

Forwarding of company-confidential business emails, and documents to personal
external email addresses.

Note: DVELP may retrieve messages from archives and servers without prior notice
if DVELP has sufficient reason to do so. If deemed necessary, an investigation
will be conducted with the knowledge and approval of the Information Security
Officer and the CEO.

### Unacceptable Use of Utility Programs

Utility software is system software designed to help to analyse, configure,
optimize or maintain a computer. Another common use is for automatically backing
up your hard drive to a remote server or external hard drive. While utility
programs of this type are not categorically prohibited, we require a clear
separation between directories containing DVELP content on any machine and
directories containing personal content. Any one utility program should only
have access to one type of directory.

## Personal Mobile Phone and Tablet Usage

All personal mobile computing devices used to access DVELP-managed data must be
passcode-enabled. 2FA will be enforced by the Security team for all employee and
contractor dvelp.co.uk and GSuite accounts.  Mobile computing best practices
dictate that these devices should be running the latest version of the operating
system and all new patches applied.  For assistance with determining the
suitability of your mobile device, please contact the Information Security
Officer.

## Use of External Media on Company Assets

The use of removable and external storage devices such as USB flash drives and
external backup drives on company-managed devices is not sanctioned.

If there is a business need for the use of an external storage device, such as a
flash drive or an external hard drive on company devices, please contact the
[Information Security Officer](../README.md#contacts) at <security@dvelp.co.uk>
to determine the most suitable encryption-enabled device.  All external and
removable storage devices must be encrypted and protected by a passcode. Any
external and removable storage devices must be wiped within 1 month of the
relevant's project close. Any exceptions to the ban of external media are to be
tracked in the [Security Reporting Trello
Board](https://trello.com/b/Hx0o5GpZ/security-reporting).

## Use of printed materials

Where possible we work exclusively with soft copies of documents that contain
sensitive information according to our our [Classification
Matrix](./classification-of-information.md). If it is necessary to work with
printed copies, we shred these as soon as possible and no later than 1 month
after the close of the relevant engagement. Until their destruction, paper
copies need to be kept locked up in filing cabinets outside of office hours.

## Displaying sensitive information

Data users should ensure that individual monitors do not show [sensitive
information](./classification-of-information.md) to passers-by and that they log
off from their computer when it is left unattended.

## Policy Compliance

Compliance with this policy will be verified through various methods, including
but not limited to, automated reporting, audits, and feedback to the policy
owner.

Any team member or contractor found to be in violation of this policy may be
subject to [disciplinary action](../hr/disciplinary-procedure.md), up to and
including termination of employment, or contractual agreement.

Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Information Security Officer.
