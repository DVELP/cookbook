# Information Security Charter

DVELP is committed to delivering an Information Security framework, in line
with the ISO 27001 Information Security Standard, to improve the resiliency of
business processes and foster awareness across our distributed team and amongst
our customers.

Security is represented at the highest level within the company. Our CEO
meets regularly with the Executive Team to discuss issues and co-ordinate
company wide initiatives.

The framework, approved by management, is designed as a functional tool, to be
referred to in the day-to-day, to improve awareness, define best practices and
crystalise key processes for prevention and resolution of information security
related issues.
