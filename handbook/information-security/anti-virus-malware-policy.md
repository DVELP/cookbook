# Anti-Virus & Malware Policy

This document covers the requirements to protect against malicious code,
including but not exclusive to viruses, Trojans, ransomware, mail bombs, worms
and mobile code - collectively known as malware.

Malicious code can result in data loss, system damage and potentially severe
disruption in service, which can lead to reputational damage and failure to
deliver on our customer promise.

The following guidelines aim to protect, to an appropriate level, the desktops,
laptops and mobile devices of employees and contractors who deliver
services to and on behalf of DVELP Ltd.

* **Anti-virus software** must be installed, running and kept up-to-date on a
  weekly basis. If the software comes bundled as part of the Operating System
  (Windows 10 and above or MacOSX), auto-system updates must be enabled and
  installed within 1 day when prompted.

* **Downloading and running software.** The following software should not be
  downloaded or run on any device used for any activity relating to DVELP.

  * Unlicensed software
  * P2P file sharing platforms (e.g. Limewire, Kazaa)
  * Software downloaded from the Dark Web
  * Software that allows remotely accessing your laptop without requiring
    explicit permission at the beginning of every session

* **Spam, hoaxes and spear-fishing.** Many malware variants are sent via email,
  illegitmate websites or targeted attacks. Be aware of email from unknown
  senders, with topical subject lines and attachments. If you receive an email
  suspected to be malicious, be sure not to forward it on.

* **Firewalls and sharing services.** All devices that support a firewall must
  have it enabled to prevent inbound and outbound traffic from unauthorised
  applications. All sharing services (screen, file, internet) must be disabled
  by default. In the event sharing is required by a trusted party, it may be
  enabled for and disabled immediately after the session.


Although these guidelines cannot guarantee to fully protect against malware and
associated adverse effects, their aim is to reduce the risk to both individual
and DVELP as a whole.

In the event a virus or other malware is identified, please report it to
<security@dvelp.co.uk>.
