# Product Designer
Our Product Designers are fundamental to the product creation process. Designers
help turn concepts into solutions.

As a Product organisation we are focused on aesthetics and ergonomics
in equal measure. Our Product Designers have deep expertise in balancing both
requirements to create solutions that deliver seamless user experience with
on-point look and feel.

## Responsibilities
Our Product Designers take full responsibility for all aspects of product
design, including but not exclusive to:

- UI Design (full lifecycle)
- UX Design (full lifecycle)
- Product Marketing Material

### Translate
A key requirement of our Product Designers is to work closely with engineering
teams to translate complex technical problems into real-world, customer facing
solutions that focus on delivery of value and ease of use.

Our Product Designers act as the mouthpiece of the customer to create an open
and continual feedback loop.

### Own The Journey
Our Product Designers are expected to own the customer journey through any given
product. The Journey starts at discovery material and works through initial
on-boarding and engagement to continued consumption.

### Pixel Perfect
We obsess over detail and value aesthetics in the highest regard. Our Product
Designers are Pixel Perfect.

### Continual Innovation
Our products are living, breathing entities, which require continued attention
and iterative improvement. Our Product Designers operate a data-lead approach to
continual innovation.

## Communication
The Product Designer has two key stakeholder sets for communication:

### Internal
* *Engineering:* Work closely with engineering teams to designer user journey's
  and provide clear and consistent feedback from customers
* *Sales & Marketing:* Provide relevant product design packs to support Sales
  and Marketing initiatives
* *Product Management:* [Report](#reporting) key updates on UI & UX design,
  which are on the critical delivery path

### External
* *Customers:* Build a process to continuously collect and evaluate customer
  feedback

## Reporting
Our Product Designers may work on a single product or across an array of smaller
products. In each case, they report directly in to the
[Product Owner](product-owner).
