# Product Owner
The Product Owner is a key stakeholder and ultimate guardian of the product
which they own. They are deeply embedded in all aspects of the product and
empowered to steer product roadmaps and build the supporting team to be
successful.

## Responsibilities
Our Product Owners take full responsibility for all elements associated with the
product lifecycle through ideation to delivery. Our Product Owners equally hold
fiduciary duties including budgets for headcount and marketing as well as
regulatory, legal and compliance obligations.

### Define The Vision
Based on a deep understanding of the industry and lead by customer intimacy, the
Product Owner is responsible for defining, validating and communication the
vision for the product.

The product vision will act as the soundboard for all future decisions around
roadmap and feature delivery.

### Prioritise
Prioritisation is the single most important responsibilty after the vision has
been established. Our Product Owners must factor in all competing priorities
and contstraints including budgets, customer needs, industry trends and
infrastructure or technical requirements.

### Manage The Agile Process
We deliver projects in line with the Agile methodology.

To help ensure all focus remains on delivering the vision and solving the
identified problem set, an effective Product Owner will manage all Agile
processes including backlog grooming, daily standups, sprint planning and
retrospectives.

### Hands on Through Delivery
Our Product Owners build close working relationship with the engineering teams
and will be hands on through the delivery cycles. They are always on hand to
help make critical decisions about functionality and implementation detail.

### Obssess About Detail
The product organisation is laser focused on detail. Product Owners will mirror
this obsession to all aspects of the product they own.

## Communication
The Product Owner has two key stakeholder sets for communication:

### Internal

  sales organisations

  professional services and support teams on key aspects of the product

  commercial progress

### External
* *Customers:* Maintain a regular cadence with customers to inform of product
updates, roadmap and broader educational material
* *Regulatory Bodies:* Inform appropriate regulatory bodies of applicable
changes and impacts
