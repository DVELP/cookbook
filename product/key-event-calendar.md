# Key Event Calendar
The following diagram covers the key events we conduct throughout the year to
provide structure and maintain momentum.

## Product Forums
We conduct Product Forums every 6 weeks. The Forum is open for 4 hours, during
which time we invite our teams and other stakeholders across the business to
share their ideas with us.

We welcome all ideas and any feedback or insight that can be shared to help us
get a better understanding of our customer needs, product gaps or market
opportunities.

If you have a feature or [Net New Product](contributing/#net-new-products)
idea you would like to discuss, all we ask is that you send over your
[canvas]() 1 week in advance so we have time to prepare.

We will typically spend 30 minutes per canvas.

At the end of each discussion you should have a clear plan for next steps to
move it forward.

## Quarterly Business Review (QBR)
QBR are run at the beginning of each Financial Quarter and are retrospective.
The QBR will encapsulate, but is not limited to the following:

- Financial performance review
- Roadmap review and progress check
- Individual product budget and resource requirement review
- Celebrate key wins
- Guest speakers

As part of the QBR, we will also run a [Product Forum](#product-forum) for new
ideas.

## Annual Business Review & Budgeting
In the last 6 weeks of the financial year, we will conduct a series of sessions
in preparation for the coming financial year. These will include:

- Extended QBR
- Product Forum
- Discuss and define key strategic themes
- Resource planning and funding review for existing and new products
