## Product Forums
We conduct Product Forums every 6 weeks.

The Forum is designed to continually evaluate new and existing products or
propositions and to provide structure and visibility to create a
cyclical process.

The Forum is open for a day, during which time we invite our teams and other
stakeholders across the business to share, discuss and evaluate their ideas with
us.

The product forums will be broken down into the following segments to help guide
progress through the cycle:

- [Evaluate Opportunity](#evaluate-opportunity)
- [Concept Proposition](#concept-proposition)
- [Investment](#investment)
- [Launch Check](#launch-check)
- [Evaluate Success](#evaluate-success)

### Evaluate Opportunity
We welcome all ideas and any feedback or insight that can be shared to help us
get a better understanding of our customer needs, product gaps or market
opportunities.

If you have a feature or [Net New Product](contributing/#net-new-products)
idea you would like to discuss, all we ask is that you send over your
[canvas]() 1 week in advance so we have time to prepare.

We will typically spend 30 minutes per canvas.

At the end of each discussion you should have a clear plan for next steps to
move it forward.

### Concept Proposition
- What is the proposed offer and how is it differentiated in the market?
- Should/can we build this?
- Is the market opportunity large enough to justify focus and investment?
- What's the resource requirement and who is needed to deliver it?

### Investment
- What's the offer?
- Is it aligned with our strategic initiatives?
- How many people are needed to build and support it?
- What's the ROI timeframe?
- What are the risks?

### Launch Check
- Is the product ready for public consumption (MVP)?
- Is the offer ready to launch commercially?
- What are the risks and dependencies?
- What are the key metrics to measure success?

### Evaluate Success
- How is the offer delivering against KPIs?
- What is the market feedback?
- What opportunities are there for improvement or iteration?
