# Running a Demo

Demos are a fundamental part of our core belief to 'show value early'.

Running a demo helps to show progress, keeps the team informed and builds trust
with the client.

The following is a guide to help the demo run smoothly.

## Set an Objective

Clarify the objective for the session. The objective shoudld explain why this demo is important and what the attendees will gain from participating.

i.e. how the demo delivers against a feature or project requirement

*Make sure you clarify this objective when the demo starts.*

Bonus points for associating the subject of the demo to a business objective.

## Recap the Steps

Clarify the steps, features or functionality you are going to run through. When
planning these steps, make sure they deliver against the objective.

*Make sure you spell these out after you have explained the objective.*

## Practice

Practice makes perfect. Before any demo, make sure you have done a dry-run so
you are comfortable and confident of the flow.

## Be Prepared

Demos often require information from other sources like customer reference
numbers, or phone numbers. Make sure you have them to hand so you don't have to
scramble to find them during the session.

## Get Excited

This is your time to show-off your hard work. You are well prepared, well practiced so time to get excited. The more enthusiastic you are, the better!
