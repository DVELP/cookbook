# Trello
A quick guide to using Trello for our projects at DVELP.

## So what is it?
A Trello board is a communal, interactive to-do list. Or as Trello puts it - "A list of lists, filled with cards, used by you and your team."

## How do we use it at DVELP?
We have a board for each project, with columns for each stage of progression. The life cycle flows from left to right. Each board starts out with a standard set of lists (below), but others can be added depending on the needs of each project.

### Each board has 7 lists:
```
* Assets
* For Discussion
* To Do
* In Progress
* Code Review
* Client Review
* Done!
```

## Assets
Create a new item on the board by selecting **Add A New Card**, at the bottom of any column. Find or add the essential elements for the project within the assets column. eg: Links to dropbox for project artwork.

## For Discussion
All tasks start their life in this column. Found a bug or potential improvement during your work? Add a card here! If you know the relevant DVELP team mate who can help, click on the card to open a lightbox, and add a member on the right hand side. Here you can also add further comments, a deadline, attach a screen grab, and more.

## To Do
The relevant team member decides what needs to be actioned in response to a **For Discussion** card. All is made clear, and the card is dragged into the **To Do** column, and assigned to a suitable team member. 

## In Progress
Once you have assigned yourself to the **To Do** card and begin the task, move the card to the **In Progress** column to let the team know it is under way.

## Code Review

### Power-Ups
Trello's Power-Ups allow us to streamline our project boards with other platforms we use. Namely **Slack**, **Harvest**, and **GitHub**. Simply click on a card to open a lightbox, and click the relevant Power-Up button on the right hand side.

### GitHub:
Click on a card, navigate to GitHub on the right hand side, and click **Attach Pull Request**. The team can then work on the code seperately from the server. Once you've sent the request, remove yourself as a user. Hover over your avatar in the top left hand side - the members area of the card, then click, and select **Remove From Card**.

### Slack:
Use the Slack power-up option to send your Trello card to a channel. Just navigate to **Slack > Send To Channel.** Team members in the Slack conversation will see that there's a card to be checked. The relevant Slack user clicks on the card, and assigns the code review to themselves. Once approved, it gets assigned back to the requesting user. That user then moves card into **Done!**

### Harvest:
Report the time spent on an item by clicking on the relevant card and selecting the Harvest power-up. Then select the task you're working on from the drop down list. After that, either start the timer, or record a historic period of time by clicking **My Timesheet**, which will launch Harvest in a new tab.
