# SCRUM Process

Scrum is the most common Agile delivery process. For this process we need people to be Scrum Masters.
Scrum Masters ensure the ceremonies happen in the right way at the right time.
It is important to note that the full Scrum Process is not needed for all our projects (eg IC&A). It is the project manager's decision how it is implemented.


## Ceremonies

The Scrum Process comprises the below ceremonies, which are described in more detail below.

* Standups
* Planning
* Reviews/Demos
* Retros
* Backlog Grooming

### Standups

* We’re used to these
* Everyone shares what they’re working on
* Highlight any blockers
* Should be high level, no detail should be discussed during stand ups
* WHY: Get everyone on the same page & show customer daily progress
* WHEN: Once a day

### Planning 

* This ceremony should happen at the start of a sprint
* Discuss the user stories (they should be in a prioritised backlog)
* Decide on an approach
* Break them into technical tasks
* We attach points to Trello cards following the (planning poker methodology)[https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker]
* Decide how much you can do in a sprint
* WHY: Discuss approach, get the team on the same page about technical approach, client is clear on what we expect to do in the upcoming sprint
* WHEN: At the beginning of the sprint

### Sprint Review/Demo

* Go through tasks done in the sprint
* Demo functionality
* WHY: Share progress with stakeholders, get feedback, show off your work
* WHEN: At the end of each sprint
* [See Annise's ToL blog post on Demos](https://dvelp.co.uk/articles/project-demos)

### Retros

* What went well, what could be improved
* Actions
* [Trello template](https://trello.com/b/ZUnzy6bM/retro-template)
* Discuss the retro process itself and whether/how it could be improved
* WHY: Share how you feel, improve this process
* WHEN: At the end of each sprint
* [See Annise's ToL blog post on Retros](https://dvelp.co.uk/articles/retros-for-remote-teams)


### Backlog Grooming

* Review tickets in the backlog , starting from the bottom (new tickets should be added to the bottom of the board and not moved until grooming)
* Make sure they are relevant and clearly defined
* Is there a clear user story? Is the ticket labelled correctly?
* Agree on their priority - how does it relate to the project goals?
* Highlight any dependencies on the card
* Move the card to the correct position in the backlog based on it’s priority and dependencies
* WHY: Backlogs can get messy, keeping them tidy will make planning easier
* WHEN: At least once a sprint
