# Continuous Improvement, Support & Hosting

Ahead of [deploying a project to a live environment](/guides/project-process/go-live-checklist.md), 
it's important to agree and organise continuous improvement, support and hosting.

## Continuous Improvement

We believe that meaningful change and business value is delivered at the intersection between bold, fast-paced processes, and modern technology that facilitates them.

The platforms we build are flexible, extensible and facilitate continuous delivery. We approach improvements to the platform with the same process used in the initial delivery, broken down into 10-12 week cycles aimed at delivering against a set of clearly defined business objectives.

We work with agility to test and deploy better solutions, both for the customer and the business in short, high-value cycles. Our philosophy is to provide platforms that appreciate in value over time. For us, production deployment is only the first step in the journey.

DVELP’s Continuous Improvement is provided as a service with an expert team whose focus is to deliver against a long term strategy, post production launch.

## Support

Our support packages allow us to be on-hand to help resolve any unexpected,
unplanned issues that arise with your application.

Our support agreements come in the following packages.

Support packages do not cover the professional services time & materials
required to resolve an issue. Professional services are charged per hour, at a
pre-agreed rate, with a 1 hour minimum call out charge.

Where possible, we will attempt to resolve any reported issue before engaging
an engineer.


Support contracts are paid up-front and the minimum contract length is 12
months.
