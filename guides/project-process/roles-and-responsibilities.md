# Roles and Responsibilities

We define the below roles that are played by different members of the project team on each project.

There is not necessarily an overlap between employment title and role title, so that, for example, a Project Manager could play the role of an Account Manager. In fact, multiple roles can be played by the same person.

| Term            | Definition                                                       |

| R = Responsible | Executes on the requirement                                      |
