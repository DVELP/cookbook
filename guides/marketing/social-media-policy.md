## Be nice, and connect

Social media is an important channel for us to demonstrate one of our biggest strengths: our highly skilled team members.
By taking part of the conversation you have the power to promote the DVELP brand and build your own personal brand at the same time.
We provide copywriting and design resources if you feel you have a great idea, but are not sure how to best share.

Few guidelines to follow:
* Verify your claims and use data to support it whenever possible
* Keep your interactions conversational yet professional and tasteful
* Link back to the DVELP [website](https://dvelp.co.uk/), especially to case studies whenever possible
* Follow the law
* Protect information, both our own and of our clients. Verify that we are approved to talk about a client project before doing so
* Be humble - Never make a negative or offensive comment
* Be conscious when mixing your business and personal lives
* What you share is visible forever - When in doubt, do not post
