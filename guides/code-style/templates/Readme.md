# Templates

The following are a collection of templates that will act as a reference point
for some of the commonly used patterns and approaches throughout our codebases.

The aim of the templates is to help improve consistency of approach not just
within individual codebases, but across the entire portfolio.

These templates are not designed to be hard and fast rules, or fully functional
models, rather to act as a common starting point.

  * [Models](models.md)
  * [Services](services.md)
  * [Specs](specs)
